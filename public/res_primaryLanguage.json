      "description": "I am an avid cyclist, camper, skier, motorcyclist, and hobby collector. I come from a varied career in IT support, from running keynotes for first ladies to designing entire domain architectures, and even cyber security. Through my time in IT support I discovered my most engaging projects where I had the freedom to build my solutions to complicated problems with scripting and automation. My best friends know that when I am interested in a subject I won't let it go for anything, and I apply this tenacity for learning and understanding to all my programming and projects. Ideally, my passion for programming brings me into a fulfilling position within a diverse organization with a mission of making a positive impact on the planet and the people within it.",
